                    <h3>Photo Capture & Reset</h3>
                    <p>BlackHawk Network asked Driveline to perform a time sensitive card reset for Pre-Paid Telecom. This project included 14 POG-specific layouts with 40-96 cards per store, totaling in 4.5 hours per store. Completion was required in 2 days, with one day of clean up. Driveline was required to remove discontinued Pre-paid Telecom cards, reset backer cards, put the new card cut-in and audit the fixtures. 100% of the photos captured and data was transmitted via handheld units. </p>
