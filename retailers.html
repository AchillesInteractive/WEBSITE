                    <h3>Product Labeling</h3>
                    <p>In July 2006, Indianapolis was established as a test market for a new smoke free Tobaka product. To create more awareness, Outserts (labels) needed to be attached to PM USA brand cigarette Packs. Driveline was responsible for outsert placement in 2,000+ retail doors between July 10 through July 28, with an average time of 90 to 120 minutes for label placement.  Driveline was required to introduce the merchandiser to the retailer with an Authorization letter, as well as place Toboka labels on designated PM USA brand cigarettes. </p>

                    <h3>Photo Capture & Reset</h3>
                    <p>BlackHawk Network asked Driveline to perform a time sensitive card reset for Pre-Paid Telecom. This project included 14 POG-specific layouts with 40-96 cards per store, totaling in 4.5 hours per store. Completion was required in 2 days, with one day of clean up. Driveline was required to remove discontinued Pre-paid Telecom cards, reset backer cards, put the new card cut-in and audit the fixtures. 100% of the photos captured and data was transmitted via handheld units. </p>
