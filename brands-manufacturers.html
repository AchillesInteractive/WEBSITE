                    <h3>Product Introductions</h3>
<p>Each year, roughly 150,000 new products are introduced by consumer packaged goods manufacturers.* In utilizing your shelf space, it's important to not only have a sound strategy for merchandising new products, but also a trustworthy resource to carry it out. Driveline takes that process out of the hands of store associates and delivers new product on the shelves with unbeatable speed, quality and accuracy, no matter the scale. </p><p class="asterisk">* According to research by SymphonyIRI</p>

                    <h3>Small Reset Capability</h3>
                    <p>Proctor & Gamble asked Driveline to reset 10,000 Dollar Stores, totaling over 50,000 hours.  Over a rolling 3-4 day execution window, multiple store formats were created, averaging 4-8 hours per store. These resets were 100% complete in all stores within two weeks. Driveline moved 8,018 shelves per store in order to reset 24ft sections of Liquid Laundry Detergent, totaling POP installation of 25 items per store, or 140,000 pieces.</p>

                    <p>Frito Lay asked Driveline to perform a salty snack audit for over 18,000 grocery stores. This project totaled in 22,000 hours over 127 different chains and formats. There were a total of 124 questions per survey, taking 1-2 hours per store. Driveline recorded all data for the in-store aisle and fixture surveys through handheld units, which were also used for all transmission.  These audits and surveys required a survey guide and a tape measure.</p>

                    <p>In July 2006, Indianapolis was established as a test market for a new smoke free Tobaka product. To create more awareness, outserts (labels) needed to be attached to PM USA brand cigarette Packs. Driveline was responsible for outsert placement in 2,000+ retail doors between July 10 through July 28, with an average time of 90 to 120 minutes for label placement.  Driveline was required to introduce the merchandiser to the retailer with an Authorization letter, as well as place Toboka labels on designated PM USA brand cigarettes.</p>

                    <h3>Small Reset Capability</h3>
                    <p>Proctor & Gamble asked Driveline to reset 10,000 Dollar Stores, totaling over 50,000 hours.  Over a rolling 3-4 day execution window, multiple store formats were created, averaging 4-8 hours per store. These resets were 100% complete in all stores within two weeks. Driveline moved 8,018 shelves per store in order to reset 24ft sections of Liquid Laundry Detergent, totaling POP installation of 25 items per store, or 140,000 pieces. </p>

                    <h3>Product Labeling</h3>
                    <p>In July 2006, Indianapolis was established as a test market for a new smoke free Tobaka product. To create more awareness, Outserts (labels) needed to be attached to PM USA brand cigarette Packs. Driveline was responsible for outsert placement in 2,000+ retail doors between July 10 through July 28, with an average time of 90 to 120 minutes for label placement.  Driveline was required to introduce the merchandiser to the retailer with an Authorization letter, as well as place Toboka labels on designated PM USA brand cigarettes. </p>

                    <p>BlackHawk Network asked Driveline to perform a time sensitive card reset for Pre-Paid Telecom. This project included 14 POG-specific layouts with 40-96 cards per store, totaling in 4.5 hours per store. Completion was required in 2 days, with one day of clean up. Driveline was required to remove discontinued Pre-paid Telecom cards, reset backer cards, put the new card cut-in and audit the fixtures. 100% of the photos captured and data was transmitted via handheld units. </p>
